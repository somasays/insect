# Security Analysis Features - Coming Soon

## Anti-Theft Protection Checks

### Browser Data Theft Protection
- [x] Detect browser history/cookies access patterns
- [x] Identify attempts to read browser storage files
- [x] Flag suspicious browser extension interactions
- [x] Monitor for browser session hijacking attempts
- [x] Detect credential harvesting from browser password stores

### Cryptocurrency Wallet Protection  
- [ ] Scan for wallet file access patterns (wallet.dat, keystore files)
- [ ] Detect private key extraction attempts
- [ ] Identify seed phrase harvesting code
- [ ] Flag suspicious crypto API interactions
- [ ] Monitor for wallet address enumeration

### Additional Security Enhancements
- [ ] System information gathering detection
- [ ] Keylogger pattern identification
- [ ] Screen capture/recording detection
- [ ] Network traffic interception checks
- [ ] Process injection/DLL hijacking detection
- [ ] Registry manipulation monitoring (Windows)
- [ ] SSH key theft detection
- [ ] Email client data access patterns
- [ ] File encryption/ransomware behavior detection
- [ ] Persistence mechanism identification
- [ ] Anti-debugging/VM detection evasion
