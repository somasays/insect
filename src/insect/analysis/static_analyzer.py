"""
Static code analyzer for detecting malicious code patterns.

This module serves as a unified interface to the more specialized analyzers:
1. Python static analyzer - for Python code
2. JavaScript static analyzer - for JavaScript/TypeScript code
3. Binary analyzer - for analyzing binary files

Each analyzer implements specific detection rules for its target file type.
