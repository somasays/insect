**Implementation**:

1. Analyze the library's source repository:
   ```bash
   insect clone https://github.com/author/js-library --report-path library-security-assessment.json
   ```

2. Review the security findings and risk assessment

3. Generate detailed report for team review:
   ```bash
   insect clone https://github.com/author/js-library --scan-args "--format html --sensitivity high" --report-path library-detailed-analysis.html
   ```

4. Make informed decision based on security findings

**Benefits**:
- Identifies potential security risks before integration
- Provides documentation for security reviews
- Helps avoid introducing vulnerabilities through dependencies
- Enables informed decision-making about external code

### Use Case: Vendor Software Evaluation

**Scenario**: A security team needs to assess multiple vendor tools before procurement decisions.

**Implementation**:

1. Create systematic evaluation process:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # vendor-evaluation.sh
   
   VENDORS=("vendor1/product" "vendor2/solution" "vendor3/tool")
   ASSESSMENT_DIR="./vendor-assessments/$(date +%Y%m)"
   
   mkdir -p "$ASSESSMENT_DIR"
   
   for vendor_repo in "${VENDORS[@]}"; do

   ```

2. Analyze proposed update:
   ```bash
   insect clone https://github.com/vendor/package --branch v1.3.0 --report-path candidate-v1.3.0.json
   ```

3. Compare security profiles:
   ```bash
   # Compare findings counts
