# Active Context: Insect

## 1. Current Work Focus

The project is currently at the **very beginning of the implementation phase**. The immediate focus is on **Phase 1: Environment Setup, Project Structure & Foundational Tooling** as defined in the detailed task list.

## 2. Recent Changes / Accomplishments

* Project concept defined and refined (initially "SafeClone", now "Insect").
* Detailed Project Specification created.
* Technical Stack and Backend/Frontend structures documented.
* Comprehensive, detailed Implementation Plan created, emphasizing PyPI distribution and concurrent testing.
* A step-by-step Task List derived from the implementation plan was generated in Markdown format for AI agent execution.
* These core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have just been created.

## 3. Next Steps

* **Execute Task 1.1:** Verify Python (>= 3.8) and Git are installed and accessible in the development environment.
* **Proceed sequentially** through the tasks listed in the **Phase 1** section of the `TASKLIST: Project Insect Implementation` document.
* Mark tasks as complete (`- [x]`) in the task list as they are finished.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

* **Project Name:** Insect
* **Core Language:** Python >= 3.8
* **Distribution Method:** PyPI package (`insect-scanner`)
* **Development Methodology:** Follow the detailed task list, implementing features and corresponding tests concurrently.
* **Environment:** Use `venv` for virtual environments.
* **Tooling:** Utilize `pytest`, `black`, `flake8`, `mypy` as defined in `techContext.md`.
* **Primary Goal:** Focus on delivering the core static analysis capabilities outlined in the project brief and scope first.
